## 0.1.0

Initial release: a headless, AI-native knowledge system for humans and agents.

### Added

- **Ingest pipeline** (`POST /v1/spaces/{space}/ingest`, async): sources
  (markdown, text or URL) are archived verbatim with sha256 dedup, classified
  against the concept index, synthesized into concept revisions with claims,
  citations and relations, checked for exact-frame contradictions, and staged
  as one pending ChangeProposal per run.
- **Review gate**: proposal content is staged as real rows, structurally
  invisible to readers; `GET /v1/proposals/{id}` renders a structured diff
  (JSON, or `text/markdown` via Accept); approve/reject are atomic SQL
  functions with stale-base protection, reviewer audit and space-epoch bump.
- **Claims model**: subject/predicate/object statements with confidence,
  verbatim-quote citations and a lifecycle
  (`proposed → verified → disputed → deprecated`); contradicting pairs are
  disputed on approval and linked with a `contradicts` relation.
- **Decisions** as first-class records (context, decision, rationale,
  alternatives), extracted from meeting-style sources.
- **LLM-free query core**: PostgreSQL full-text `search` with `<mark>`
  headlines, and `lint` (contradictions, missing citations, broken relations,
  stale claims, orphans, …) as a CI-consumable report.
- **Grounded Q&A** (`POST /v1/spaces/{space}/query`): answers only from
  retrieved evidence with inline citations, flags disputed claims, and says
  "not in the knowledge base" instead of hallucinating.
- **MCP server** (Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`): scope-gated tool visibility with
  `wikikit_search`, `wikikit_read`, `wikikit_sources`, `wikikit_history`,
  `wikikit_lint`, `wikikit_ingest`, `wikikit_ingest_status`,
  `wikikit_propose` — deliberately no approve tool; session leases with idle
  TTL, hard cap and hijack guards.
- **Export/import**: deterministic zip bundles as an Obsidian-friendly
  Markdown tree (claims round-trip losslessly via frontmatter) or as an OKF
  v0.1 bundle; imports pass the same review gate as LLM output.
- **Standard Webhooks**: signed events (`wikikit.proposal.created`,
  `proposal.approved`, `proposal.rejected`, `concept.updated`,
  `ingest.failed`) from a transactional outbox with backoff and a circuit
  breaker.
- **Auth**: scoped, optionally space-scoped `wk_` API keys hashed with an
  HMAC pepper; scopes `knowledge:read` / `knowledge:propose` /
  `knowledge:approve` / `admin`.
- **Ops**: OpenAPI 3.1 generated live from the route registry
  (`/openapi.json`, with a committed snapshot), `llms.txt`/`llms-full.txt`
  served, Prometheus `/metrics`, `/health` and `/ready` probes, structured
  JSON logs, graceful drain, self-migrating single Bun binary
  (`--migrate`/`--version` ops flags), zero-config local development, and
  drift tests keeping code, spec and docs in lockstep.
